<h2 class="chapter">12 Profile</h2>

<p>In this chapter, we explain how grammars can be profiled. Because the
XDK solver is a constraint solver, XDG profiling amounts to profiling
a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in terms of constraint
programming. To this end, the XDK provides the means to count the
number of constraint variables and the number of propagators
introduced for a particular CSP, which corresponds to a particular
&ldquo;parse&rdquo;.

   <p>Let us proceed with an example. Please start the GUI of the XDK
(<code>xdk.exe</code>) and open the grammar file <code>Grammars/Acl01.ul</code>. 
Now, the XDK provides us with two different profile operations:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>profile grammar (independent of the input string)
(menu <code>Extras/Profile grammar...</code>)
<li>profile sentence (depends on the input string)
(menu <code>Extras/Profile sentence...</code>)
        </ol>
In short, the first operation counts the number of constraint
variables the grammar introduces for each node in an analysis, but
neither takes the principle constraint functors nor the input string
into account. The second operation does take the input string and the
principle constraint functors into account and counts the exact number
of constraint variables and propagators introduced for a particular
input string.

<h3 class="section">12.1 Profile grammar</h3>

<p>Let us try this out. Choose <code>Extras/Profile grammar...</code>  first. 
This leads to the Inspector printing out the constraint variables
(<code>fd</code>: finite domain, <code>fs</code>: finite set, <code>fdfs</code> sum of
<code>fd</code> and <code>fs</code>) which the grammar introduces for each node in
an analysis. The printout is an Oz pair of two records:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first
record has the features <code>attrs</code>, <code>entry</code>, <code>label</code>,
<code>model</code> and <code>node</code>. The <code>attrs</code> feature harbors the
constraint variable counts for the node attributes of the individual
dimensions of the grammar and a combined count over all
dimensions. The <code>entry</code> feature harbors the counts for the
lexical attributes, <code>model</code> for the constraint variables
introduced by the model record of the principles used in the grammar,
and <code>node</code> the additional constraint variables introduced by the
XDK solver (this is hard-wired into the solver). <code>label</code> gives an
additional count of the edge labels introduced for the individual
dimensions. 
<li>The second record has the features <code>entries</code>,
<code>fd</code>, <code>fdfs</code> and <code>fs</code>. The <code>entries</code> feature is a
count of the number of lexical entries in the grammar, <code>fd</code> is
the sum of the <code>fd</code> counts of the first record, <code>fs</code> of the
<code>fs</code> counts, and <code>fdfs</code> of the <code>fdfs</code> counts.  The
latter number is the most interesting: this is the number of
constraint variables which the grammar introduces for each node in an
analysis, regardless of the additional constraint variables introduced
in the principle constraint functors.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">12.2 Profile sentence</h3>

<p>Next, we want to use the second profiling operation: profile sentence. 
Choose an input string and then <code>Extras/Profile sentence...</code>. 
This results in an Inspector printout of an Oz tuple with six
components:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The first component is a list of records corresponding to the
nodes of the analysis, each with the features <code>entries</code>,
<code>fd</code>, <code>fs</code>, <code>fdfs</code>, <code>index</code>, <code>pr</code> and
<code>word</code>. Here, <code>word</code> is the word of the node, <code>index</code>
its index, <code>entries</code> the number of possible lexical entries for
the word, <code>fd</code>, <code>fs</code> and <code>fdfs</code> count the number of
constraint variables introduced for the node, and <code>pr</code> the number
of propagators. 
<li>The second component sums up the numbers of the
<code>fd</code>, <code>fdfs</code>, <code>fs</code> and <code>pr</code> features, gives the
number of words at feature <code>words</code>, and the average of the
<code>entries</code> features at feature <code>entries</code>. 
<li>The third component gives the number of constraint variables
and propagators introduced by the individual principle constraint
functors. 
<li>The fourth component gives the number of constraint variables
and propagators introduced by the individual principle edge constraint
functors. 
<li>The fifth component gives the sum of the constraint variables
and propagators introduced by the principle constraint functors and
the edge constraint functors. 
<li>The sixth component gives the total sum of the constraint variables
and propagators introduced for the input string, and repeats the
average number of lexical entries (<code>entries</code>) and the number of
words (<code>words</code>) from the second component.
        </ol>

<h3 class="section">12.3 Integration into solving statistics</h3>

<p>The profiling functionality is also integrated into the solving
statistics which can be printed out using either <code>xdk.exe</code> or
<code>xdks.exe</code>. Here, the grammar profile can be found at the
<code>gprofile</code> element, the sentence profiles at the <code>sprofile</code>
elements, and combined counts (over the list of example sentence) at
the <code>profilecounts</code> element.

<h3 class="section">12.4 What do the numbers mean?</h3>

<p>The <code>entries</code> count of the number of lexical entries per word is
easiest to interpret &mdash; if this number is too high, you should probably
think about removing lexical ambiguity in your grammar.

   <p>The counts of the constraint variables and propagators are much more
difficult to interpret. Roughly, here, the lower the numbers the
better, but this is only an indication: it can well be the case that a
grammar with very low counts behaves exceptionally badly, probably
because it does not do enough constraint propagation to reduce search.

   <p>The ratio of variables and propagators is also an indicator: here, if
there many more variables than propagators, something is wrong - in
well programmed constraint satisfaction problems, each variable is
constrained by a number of propagators.
