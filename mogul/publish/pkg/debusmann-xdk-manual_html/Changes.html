<h2 class="chapter">16 Changes</h2>

<p>Version 1.7.0 (December 28, 2007)

   <p>Updated manual with some information about how to use the Principle
Writer.

   <p>Version 1.6.53 (December 27, 2007)

   <p>Updated manual with the latest grammars.

   <p>Version 1.6.52 (December 21, 2007)

   <p>More fixes, most importantly, fixed the CSP and FlatZinc output again. 
Until I have time for more documentation, for Flatzinc to work, you need
to install Gecode, and then the FlatZinc-reader (it's a separate program),
and then call it like this on the FlatZinc output file <code>test.fzn</code>

<pre class="example">     fz -mode stat -solutions 0 test.fzn
</pre>
   <p>Here, <code>-solutions 0</code> means &ldquo;find all solutions&rdquo;. Call <code>fz
--help</code> for the options of <code>fz</code>.

   <p>This is it for now, my last day at university has ended. End of this
year (after Xmas), I will make an official last uni-release (1.7.0 or
whatever). After that, I hope Jorge and Denys will step in again to
continue development, with me helping in my spare time (or in the time
I have when traveling to/from my new workplace SAP).

   <p>With the PW even in this shape, the XDK should actually become very
useful at least for teaching dependency grammars, but also for
developing/prototyping new kinds of dependency grammars.

   <p>Also, it is a challenging topic more in the realms of constraint
programming to continue working on the optimizer of the principle
compiler. Jorge has already done a lot of work, which he should really
bring in a form to publish, but there is ample space for more
optimizations.

   <p>Version 1.6.51 (December 21, 2007)

   <p>Lots of small fixes everywhere :)

   <p>Version 1.6.50 (December 20, 2007)

   <p>First version with 1) lots of unnecessary stuff removed (support for
deep guards, support for Gdbm, node/edge constraints, constraints
type/lattice etc.) and 2) lots of new stuff, mostly done by Jorge:
Principle Writer optimizations, memoization, lazy variables, dynamic
profiling, type inference etc. To be documented soon.

   <p>Version 1.6.43 (September 20, 2007)

   <p>Removed support for let expressions again, kept only the old PW code
not yet touched by Jorge. Jorge has implemented a new, much cooler
version of PW which I'll integrate as soon as I can... stay
tuned. It's really great stuff.

   <p>You can now use the usual valency notation using wild cards also for
tuples (PW valency principle). That is, no need to write <code>[a
"?"]</code>  anymore, just write <code>a?</code> as before.

   <p>New grammar (<code>regdgPW.ul</code>) and principles to model regular
dependency grammars (Kuhlmann/Moehl ACL 2007). Being able to model
regular dependency grammars means that we can prove that XDG is at
least as expressive as LCFRS!

   <p>Added fix to <code>GraphPWConstraints</code>, was incomplete if confronted
with cyclic graphs.

   <p>Version 1.6.42 (July 23, 2007)

   <p>Added support for let expressions done by Jorge. Thanks again!

   <p>Added new node record feature <code>pos</code>, and removed the <code>pos</code>
feature from all order principle model record definitions. That means
that now all dimensions share the same positions for their nodes.

   <p>Great simplification: the solver can now be explicitly instructed to
&ldquo;parse&rdquo;, i.e., to equate the position with the index, or
&ldquo;generate&rdquo;, i.e., leave the <code>pos</code> feature untouched and
distribute over it. The switch is in the <code>Search</code> pulldown menu
(or the <code>--mode</code>/<code>-m</code> commandline switch).

   <p>This change bereaves the XDK somewhat of its flexibility, but makes it
much simpler as well. And, most important, it fits better with the
latest formalizations of XDG.

   <p>As a consequence of this simplification, I could remove the
<code>Parse</code> and <code>SameOrder</code> principles.

   <p>Added hand-optimized versions of some of the PW principles suffixed
<code>PW1.oz</code> in <code>Solver/Principles/Lib</code>. Now we need a
compositional way of obtaining these optimizations...

   <p>Version 1.6.41 (July 20, 2007)

   <p>Added a transparent fix of <code>FS.reified.include</code> to
<code>Share.oz</code>. <code>FS.reified.include</code> is broken in Mozart 1.3.2
(see Mozart users list), as Jorge has found out by deep private
investigation. Thanks a lot! The fix however makes the XDK slower, I
hope there will be a fix to Mozart someday.

   <p>First version of <code>dissPW.ul</code> works with only PW principles, same
number of solutions (except for one sentence), and almost the same
propagation, but much slower as the principles are not yet optimized.

   <p>Version 1.6.40 (July 19, 2007)

   <p>Continued writing PW principles for <code>dissPW.ul</code>. Now finished,
almost works properly :-)

   <p>Version 1.6.39 (July 18, 2007)

   <p>Important bugfixes to <code>xdk.oz</code> (Inspect Lexical Entries) and
<code>Compiler/Lattices/Set.oz</code> (<code>EncodeProc1</code> only worked
properly for intersective sets).

   <p>New principles for new grammar <code>dissPW.ul</code> (dissertation grammar
with PW principles).

   <p>Added set generator expressions and unequality to PW language, added
set equality to <code>Solver/Principles/Lib/PW.oz</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.38 (July 17, 2007)

   <p>Integrated IsIn optimization code into the
<code>Solver/Principles/Lib/PW.oz</code>, thereby simplified the optimizer a
lot. Same efficiency!

   <p>Version 1.6.37 (July 16, 2007)

   <p>Added new optimizations for
negations/conjunctions/disjunctions/equivalences.

   <p>Added <code>PrincipleWriter</code> directory containg the work-in-progress
principle compiler.

   <p>Version 1.6.36 (July 13, 2007)

   <p>Slight addition to the grammar record specification: now includes
feature <code>as</code>, a list of all words in the lexicon of the grammar.

   <p>Added slight optimization to PW: now, all lattices used for encoding
are created only once at the beginning of the constraint functor. As a
result, all automatically generated functors with suffix <code>PW1</code>
are now as fast (even a bit faster) as their quasi-automatically
generated functors with suffix <code>PW</code>.

   <p>Removed all grammars and principles with suffix <code>PW1</code>, and
replaced the principles with automatically generated ones using the
latest PW.

   <p>Version 1.6.35 (July 12, 2007)

   <p>Modularized PW. Now we have an executable <code>pw.exe</code> in the
<code>PrincipleWriter</code> subdirectory, which is the first live running
version of PW! It still misses type inference and type checking, but
it does already do some optimizations. To compile a principle and add
it to the principle library, type:
<pre class="example">     pw.exe -p Examples/valencyPW.ul
</pre>
   <p>To omit the optimizations, add <code>--nooptimize</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.34 (July 11, 2007)

   <p>Added further optimizations to PW and indentation a la the emacs mode
for Oz. Ready to be modularized tomorrow.

   <p>Fixed a bug in <code>pwtest1.oz</code> found by Jorge Marques Pelizzoni.

   <p>Version 1.6.33 (July 9, 2007)

   <p>Now the PW works for the first time and generates non-optimized
principles. Used it to generate all <code>PW1</code>-suffixed principles,
and, voila, seems to work with the example grammars.

   <p>Lots of stuff still to do:
     <ul>
<li>clean up, split into several functors
<li>error detection and sensible error messages (type checking)
<li>type inference
<li>optimizations (as seen in the manually implemented <code>PW</code>-suffixed principles)
<li>new Mozart code for adding new principles to the system (replacing
the old perl-based scripts which do not have error checking)
</ul>

   <p>Version 1.6.32 (July 5, 2007)

   <p>New PW grammars <code>nut1PW.ul</code> and <code>nut1PW1.ul</code>, the
latter again unoptimized, imaginary PW output.

   <p>New PW principles <code>principle.agrPW</code>,
<code>principle.agreementPW</code>, <code>principle.dagPW</code>,
<code>principle.linkingEndPW</code> and <code>principle.linkingMotherPW</code>,
and unoptimized versions with suffix <code>1</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.31 (July 3, 2007)

   <p>Changed lexicalized order principle such that <code>^</code> is an edge
label again, but there cannot be any edges labeled <code>^</code>. Also
changed all grammars using the principle accordingly.

   <p>Removed type union/disjunction (not needed anymore).

   <p>Worked a lot on the new PW principles to make them as efficient as the
original ones.

   <p>Duplicated the PW principles: now, there is always one version which
is optimized as far as possible (e.g. <code>principle.orderPW</code>), and
one which is not optimized, marked by a suffixed <code>1</code>
(e.g. <code>principle.orderPW1</code>). Accordingly, the grammars
<code>ANBNPW.ul</code> and <code>EQABPW.ul</code> use the optimized, and
<code>ANBNPW1.ul</code> and <code>EQABPW1.ul</code> the unoptimized principles.

   <p>Version 1.6.30 (June 8, 2007)

   <p>Improvements to and optimizations of the new PW principles.

   <p>Version 1.6.31 (June 5, 2007)

   <p>New principles <code>principle.orderPW</code> and
<code>principle.projectivityPW</code>, and new grammar <code>ANBNPW.ul</code>, again
to support the ongoing &ldquo;PrincipleWriter&rdquo; work.

   <p>Version 1.6.29 (June 4, 2007)

   <p>New principles <code>principle.graphPW</code>, <code>principle.treePW</code> and
<code>principle.valencyPW</code> and new grammar <code>EQABPW.ul</code> to support
the ongoing work on the principle compiler &ldquo;PrincipleWriter&rdquo;.  The
principles are basically what should be obtained from the compiler when
it works.

   <p>Version 1.6.28 (May 4, 2007)

   <p>Solving statistics now supports a timeout, i.e., solving is interrupted
after a fixed amount of time. The default is 3600 (1 hour). Notice that
the timeout is checked only at choice points/solutions/failures in the
search tree, i.e., it may take longer than the timeout to reach the
first fixpoint and thus it may take longer to solve in overall despite
the timeout.

   <p>Changed defaults for solving statistics in <code>xdk.exe</code> and
<code>xdks.exe</code> again: the maximum number of solutions is 9999 again, as
is the maximum number of failures.

   <p>Version 1.6.27 (April 27, 2007)

   <p>New tool for extracting example sentence files from Penn Treebank
<code>*.pos</code> files (tagged). The tool is called <code>ptbextraxt.exe</code>
and lets you also specify the minimum and maximum length of the
sentences to be extracted. The vocabulary of the sentences is adapted
to the XTAG grammar found in the current lem distribution (0.14.0).

   <p>Made fixed recomputation with recomputation distance 5 the default for
<code>xdk.exe</code>, for Explorer, IOzSeF and Oracle search. This has the
effect that exploring even large search spaces will not immediately
lead to a rather unresponsible system.

   <p>Added new option for solving statistics (<code>xdk.exe</code> and
<code>xdks.exe</code>) to specify the maximum number of failures. Using this
and the possibility to specify the maximum number of solutions helps
to terminate the search for solutions before it goes on forever.

   <p>Consistently made executables lower case (except for the included SXDG
directory). Hence, <code>ManualOracleServer.exe</code> is now called
<code>manualoracleserver.exe</code>, and <code>XTAGServer.exe</code>
<code>xtagserver.exe</code>.

   <p>Many other small improvements.

   <p>Version 1.6.26 (April 23, 2007)

   <p>Now CSPs can be printed into files whose filename can be conveniently
chosen. No more printing out to stdout.

   <p>Added experimental functionality to print out CSPs using FlatZinc
syntax. This is a new standard syntax for constraint solvers,
developed by the G12 project at several universities in Australia (see
<a href="http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/Summary.html">http://www.g12.cs.mu.oz.au/Summary.html</a>). In particular, the
Gecode constraint library will soon support FlatZinc officially, which
means that this gets the XDK one step closer to integration with
Gecode.

   <p>Printing out CSPs now also works with the standalone solver
<code>xdks.exe</code>.

   <p>New file suffixes: <code>csp</code> for printed out CSPs, <code>fzn</code> for
printed out CSPs using FlatZinc syntax, and <code>sol</code> for solutions
obtained from the program <code>explore.exe</code> in <code>CSPOutput</code>.

   <p>Many small bugfixes and enhancements.

   <p>Version 1.6.25 (April 11, 2007)

   <p>Slight fix to XTAG grammar generation to adapt to the new output
functors (which display the words of <code>word</code> features of all
dimensions, not just <code>lex</code>): the <code>word</code> feature on the
<code>lp</code> dimension is now called <code>word1</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.24 (April 10, 2007)

   <p>Made it much easier for users from the outside to use the oracle
functionality of the XDK:
     <ul>
<li>Added the two IOzSeF packages <code>tack-iozsef-1.1.pkg</code> and
<code>tack-TkTreeWidget-0.7.pkg</code> by Guido Tack to the XDK distribution
(in case MOGUL is not available or so). 
<li>Integrated the SXDG package by Marco Kuhlmann. 
</ul>
   Now, the example oracle can be used already after simply installing
the two IOzSeF packages.

   <p>Included a license at last - CeCILL v2 (GNU-GPL-compatible).

   <p>Cleaned up a bit:
     <ul>
<li>Removed script <code>doublefdfs</code>. 
<li>Removed example files <code>pri_EQAB.oz</code> and <code>pri_EQAB_lex.oz</code>
from the XDK distribution. 
</ul>

   <p>Version 1.6.23 (February 23, 2007)

   <p>Removed the code supporting the second node-word mapping
(<code>lex.entry.word1</code>) since it was too hacky IMHO.

   <p>Now, following a discussion with Vineet Chaitanya, the output functors
(Tcl/Tk and Latex), and the <code>GenerateOrderings</code> code support the
possibility of additional node-word mappings on any other
dimension. An example is given in the grammar <code>Grammars/MWE.ul</code>,
where the syntactic dimensions (<code>id</code> and <code>lp</code>) have a word
feature different from that on the semantic dimension (<code>pa</code>). Now
if the grammar shall be used for parsing, the input word feature
(<code>lex.entry.word</code>) is unified with the syntactic word and the
parsing principle is switched on. If the grammar shall be used for
generation, the input word feature is unified with the semantic word,
and the parse principle switched off. This is implemented in the
example grammar <code>Grammars/MWEgen.ul</code>.

   <p>Added three work-in-progress example grammars:
<code>Grammars/MTS10.ul</code>, a grammar where two context-free grammars
are combined to model scrambling, and <code>Grammars/FG_TAGDC.ul</code> and
<code>Grammars/FG_TAGDCgen.ul</code>, where a TAG grammar and a grammar for
dominance constraints (modeled as in the dissertation) are combined.

   <p>Version 1.6.22 (February 19, 2007)

   <p>Wrote a new principle <a href="XTAGLinking.html#XTAGLinking">XTAGLinking</a> which combines the now removed
<code>principle.linkingEnd1</code> and <a href="SameEdges.html#SameEdges">SameEdges</a>.

   <p>Added code to <code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Helpers.oz</code> that generates the
records encoding the dominance/precedence relations on Gorn addresses
on-the-fly for the <a href="XTAG1.html#XTAG1">XTAG1</a> and <a href="XTAGRedundant.html#XTAGRedundant">XTAGRedundant</a> principles.

   <p>These two steps greatly simplify the writing of TAG grammars, as can be
observed e.g. in the grammar <a href="ww.html#ww">ww</a>.

   <p>Further improved the GenerateOrderings dialog.

   <p>The GenerateOrderings function and all DAG output functors now recognize
whether a grammar as the feature <code>lex.entry.word1</code>, which is a
feature additional to <code>lex.entry.word</code>, modeling a second
&ldquo;node-word mapping&rdquo;. This is convenient for generation, as e.g. in the
grammar <a href="MWEgen.html#MWEgen">MWEgen</a>, where the <code>lex.entry.word1</code> feature denotes
the generated word for the node.

   <p>Version 1.6.21 (February 18, 2007)

   <p>Improved the <code>GenerateOrderings</code> functionality of the GUI. Now,
several dimensions can be selected where the parse principle shall be
switched off. The selection is now much more comfortable using
checkbuttons instead of a text field.

   <p>Version 1.6.20 (February 17, 2007)

   <p>Updated the <a href="CSD1.html#CSD1">CSD1</a> principle to more closely reflect the diss, and
to be more configurable.

   <p>Removed the <code>principle.projectivity1</code> principle and put its
functionality into <a href="Projectivity.html#Projectivity">Projectivity</a>. Now, if a principle which
introduces a <code>yield</code> feature is used, then the <code>yield</code> set
must be convex, otherwise, the principle constrains the <code>eqdown</code>
set to be convex.

   <p>Removed the <code>Projective</code> argument variable from the <a href="Order.html#Order">Order</a>
and <a href="Order1.html#Order1">Order1</a> principles (and their variant <a href="OrderConstraints.html#OrderConstraints">OrderConstraints</a>
and <a href="Order1Constraints.html#Order1Constraints">Order1Constraints</a>). Please note: if you made use of this
argument variable to make your analyses projective, please change your
grammars to use the additional <a href="Projectivity.html#Projectivity">Projectivity</a> principle instead! 
I already changed this for the example grammars of course.

   <p>Version 1.6.19 (February 16, 2007)

   <p>Optimized XTAG principles.

   <p>Added <code>XTAGDist</code> constraint functor for distributing the
positions when the solver is used as a realizer for TAG grammars.

   <p>Updated the main page of the manual, highlighting the compiler and
solver chapters.

   <p>Fixed severe bug in <code>principle.linkingAboveStart</code>.

   <p>Fixed bug in the UL grammar file parser &mdash; could not handle missing
brackets at the end of the file.

   <p>Version 1.6.18 (February 14, 2007)

   <p>Made the XTAG principles reversible.

   <p>Version 1.6.17 (February 13, 2007)

   <p>Finished updating the functor profiles for all constraint
functors. Now the profiler gives precisely the right number of
propagators and variables, which can be tested by using the
<code>solve.exe</code> executable from the <code>CSPOutput</code> directory.

   <p>Also added a new chapter to the documentation which explains the
profiling functionality.

   <p>Version 1.6.16 (February 9, 2007)

   <p>Removed memory consumption measurements from solving statistics again
(too imprecise).

   <p>Removed copies of the <code>NewTkDAG</code> and <code>Select</code> directories
from <code>CSPOutput</code>. That is, <code>CSPOutput</code> is not stand-alone
anymore, but must be distributed with the entire XDK. Which isn't so
much of a problem, compared with the overhead of having to deal with
copies of especially the selection constraint.

   <p>Changed all hard-wired references to the <code>/tmp/</code> directory. Would
not work on Windows, and this was the reason why the XTAG code would
not work on Windows. Now it does &mdash; temporary files are now either
written to <code>/tmp/</code>, or, if that is not available, to
<code>/C/Windows/Temp</code>, or to <code>/C/Temp</code>.

   <p>Added new Windows binaries of the slighly optimized <code>Select.fs</code>
and <code>Select.union</code> constraints.

   <p>Updated constraint functor profiles using the propagator output.  Not
all done yet though.

   <p>Version 1.6.15 (February 7, 2007)

   <p>Added slight optimizations to <code>Select.fs</code> and <code>Select.union</code>. 
Not included in the Windows binary yet.

   <p>Version 1.6.14 (February 2, 2007)

   <p>Improved LOP grammar (<code>Grammars/LOP.ul</code>) and principle
(<code>Solver/Principles/Lib/LOP.oz</code>).

   <p>Version 1.6.13 (February 1, 2007)

   <p>Plugged in a reimplementation of the <code>tagger_filter.pl</code> tree
filter from the lem parser distribution. Uses the mxpost POS tagger by
Adwait Ratnaparkhi, which does not seem to be publicly available
anymore though. Works perfectly, same number of solutions as the
original lem parser. To use it, given that mxpost is properly
installed in the directory pointed to by the <code>MXPOST</code> environment
variable, call the XTAGServer as shown below:
<pre class="example">     XTAGServer.exe -f tagger
</pre>
   <p>Plugged in the supertagger available on the XTAG webpage. Can be selected
as a tree filter as shown below:
<pre class="example">     XTAGServer.exe -f supertagger
</pre>
   <p>Where the environment variable <code>COREF</code> must point to the
currently used data directory within the supertagger directory (as
stated in the <code>README</code> there), e.g. to the <code>200K.data</code>
directory.

   <p>Added a function in <code>xdk.exe</code> to compare the solutions from the
lem parser, using the tagger filter, and the XDK, using the
reimplementation of the filter.

   <p>Fixed bug in <code>LemComparer.oz</code> (would not properly handle the
distinguishing suffixes introduced in the previous version of the
XDK).

   <p>Fixed <code>XTAGRoot</code> constraint.

   <p>Cleaned up <code>Extras</code> menu of the GUI.

   <p>Version 1.6.12 (January 30, 2007)

   <p>Fixed small small bugs in <code>xdk.exe</code>.

   <p>Improved filter reimplementation. Now gets precisely the same
solutions as the lem parser when using pruning and filtering. Plugging
in a tagger/supertagger comes next.

   <p>Prepared plugging in of a tagger/supertagger to the XTAG grammar
generator. Most notably, introduced a way to distinguish multiple
occurrences of the same word by adding suffixes separated from the
word by a hash, e.g. &ldquo;a man who sleeps sleeps#1&rdquo;. Not thoroughly
tested though.

   <p>Version 1.6.11 (January 25, 2007)

   <p>Added implementation of syn lookup pruning from the lem parser, obtainable
via the <code>--prune</code> option of the the XTAGServer. Put on by default.

   <p>Version 1.6.10 (January 23, 2007)

   <p>Added reimplementation of the <code>simple_filter.pl</code> tree filter from
the lem parser distribution to the XTAG grammar server code. Can be
invoked by launching the XTAGServer using the <code>-f simple</code> option:
<pre class="example">     XTAGServer.exe -f simple
</pre>
   <p>Adapted the GUI to include two different versions of <code>Compare lem
solutions...</code> (<code>Extras</code> menu): one without filtering (useful if
you called the XTAGServer with <code>-f none</code>), and one with
filtering (if you called it with <code>-f simple</code>).

   <p>Added file <code>4712.ulsocket</code> for convenience (for easier access to
the XTAG grammar generator, given that it is started on port 4712).

   <p>Added debug output to solving statistics, showing the number of
failures and solutions (succeeded).

   <p>Version 1.6.9 (January 19, 2007)

   <p>Renamed example file <code>pri.oz</code> to <code>pri_EQAB.oz</code>.

   <p>Added example file <code>pri_EQAB_lex.oz</code>, the valency-lexicalized
version of <code>pri_EQAB.oz</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.8 (January 18, 2007)

   <p>Added missing nodeset files for <code>diss</code> and <code>LOP</code> grammars.

   <p>Changed Denys' location to Orleans at last :)

   <p>Version 1.6.7 (January 16, 2007)

   <p>stderr printouts of <code>xdkc.exe</code> and <code>xdks.exe</code> now use
<code>System.showError</code> instead of <code>System.printError</code> for better
readability.

   <p>Changed memory consumption measurement to use the <code>gc.active</code>
property.

   <p>Added scripts <code>optiOff</code> and <code>optiOn</code> to toggle the native
<code>IsIn</code> optimization.

   <p>Version 1.6.6 (January 15, 2007)

   <p>Small improvement to <code>principle.lop</code>.

   <p>Changed some defaults for solving statistics in <code>xdk.exe</code> and
<code>xdks.exe</code> profiling is now turned off per default, the maximum
number of solutions 1000 (instead of 9999), and the recomputation
distance 5 (1).

   <p>Added memory consumption to solving statistics, based on the
<code>'memory.heap'</code> property of Mozart/Oz. Also adapted the DTD
<code>Extras/statistics.dtd</code>.

   <p>Version 1.6.5 (January 12, 2007)

   <p>CSPOutput: renamed <code>solve.exe</code> to <code>explore.exe</code> and added a
new program <code>solve.exe</code> which does not call the explorer but uses
a handmade search engine to obtain solving statistics.

   <p>Improved <code>principle.lop</code> for the new LOP grammar
(<code>Grammars/LOP.ul</code>).

   <p>Version 1.6.4 (January 10, 2007)

   <p>LOP grammar and principle added.

   <p>Version 1.6.3 (January 8, 2007)

   <p>Added information about the principles and constraint functors
belonging to the propagators in the propagators output.

   <p>Added <code>Helpers.isIn</code> optimization to <code>Order2Conditions</code>, big
speed-up for grammars using the lexicalized order principle
(e.g. <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>).

   <p>Version 1.6.2 (January 5, 2007)

   <p>Removed constraints that partitioned the sets of daughters and mothers
sorted by label (<code>daughtersL</code> and <code>mothersL</code>) from the
<code>GraphMakeNodes</code> and <code>GraphMakeNodes1</code> constraint functors. 
This wrongly disallowed that nodes had multiple outgoing edges to the
same daughter node (of course with different edge labels).

   <p>Added these partitioning constraints to the <code>TreeConditions</code>
constraint functor, and, optionally (<code>DisjointDaughters</code> argument
variable) to the <code>Dag</code> constraint functor.

   <p>Changed default for the <code>Connected</code> argument of the <code>Dag</code>
constraint functor to <code>false</code>.

   <p>Adapted all grammars affected by these changes (i.e., those using the
Dag principle).

   <p>Fixed bug in <code>LinkingAboveBelow1or2StartDG</code> constraint functor.

   <p>Added constraint to <code>GraphConditions</code> and <code>GraphConditions1</code>
constraint functors for better propagation on cyclic graphs (the
<code>down</code> and <code>eqdown</code> sets were not properly constrained
whenever a node only had itself as its daughter).

   <p>Added example file <code>pri.oz</code> which is a first example of
principle compilation.

   <p>Version 1.6.1 (January 2, 2007)

   <p>Added <code>AddHandlers</code> procedure for the executable in the
<code>CSPOutput</code> directory - they were not able to find the selection
constraint when compiled from the toplevel XDK directory.

   <p>Bumped copyrights to 2007.

   <p>Version 1.6.0 (December 22, 2006)

   <p>Much much much faster CSP output thanks to an idea by Stefan Thater.

   <p>Introduced new directory <code>CSPOutput</code> for functors and programs
working with CSP output. Includes the programs <code>solve.exe</code> for
solving CSP outputs, and <code>view.exe</code> to view the solutions of CSP
outputs (saved from the Explorer in <code>solve.exe</code>).

   <p>The directory is stand-alone, e.g. it can be tar-gzipped and then be
used on a machine without the XDK installed. This is another landmark
in our transition to Gecode.

   <p>Merry Christmas BTW!

   <p>Version 1.5.8 (December 18, 2006)

   <p>Fixed bug just introduced into the IsIn optimization &mdash; it would
suspend when printing out propagators.

   <p>Changed <code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Share.oz</code> such that it now filters
out non-fd/fs variables (e.g. <code>lex.entry.word</code>).

   <p>Version 1.5.7 (December 14, 2006)

   <p>Found out why the parser had become slower - it was the IsIn
optimization in <code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Helpers.oz</code> which I had
changed to the worse. Fixed.

   <p>Removed native treeness constraint from <code>principle.tree</code> (functor
<code>TreeConditions.oz</code>. Added a new principle <code>principle.tree1</code>
(with new functor <code>TreeConditions1.oz</code>) which still includes the
native treeness constraint in case a grammar still needs it.

   <p>Version 1.5.6 (December 13, 2006)

   <p>Removed remaining deep guards from <code>principle.coindex</code> and
<code>principle.pl</code>.

   <p>Made printing propagators more efficient using a trick involving the
counter for finite domain variables available in the Properties module
of Mozart/Oz.

   <p>New script <code>doublefdfs</code> to check whether print propagators output
is buggy, introducing the same variable numbers for both finite set
and finite domain variables.

   <p>New Oz test code <code>testpropagatoroutput.oz</code> to test the print
propagators output against Mozart/Oz itself.

   <p>Continued updating the manual, grammars and principles to reflect the
state-of-the-art of the system, many many small fixes and improvements.

   <p>Version 1.5.5 (December 5, 2006)

   <p>Added logo to GUI (Project -&gt; About).

   <p>Updated the grammars to only use principles not using deep guards, except
<code>DiplomDG.ul</code> and <code>dissDG.ul</code>. This also meant that the grammars
using edge constraints had to be reformulated without. As a result, no
grammar uses edge constraints any more. Since I could also remove all node
constraints from the grammars, further versions of the XDK could drop the
expression of node and edge constraints altogether, since their benefit
is not high enough (I think) to warrant the complications they
introduce to the system.

   <p>Removed grammar <code>seg.ul</code>.

   <p>Added diss to list of references in this manual.

   <p>Version 1.5.4 (December 1, 2006)

   <p>Suffixed all constraint functors, principle definition functors and
grammars using edge constraints with DG for &ldquo;deep guards&rdquo;, and
removed the NDG suffix from those not using deep guards. As a result,
if the user e.g. uses the <code>principle.graph</code> principle, (s)he gets
the more efficient implementation without deep guards. Not quite done
yet - the grammars and the manual still need to be updated.

   <p>Thanks to my wife Simone, the XDK has a logo now:

   <div class="block-image"><img src="pix/xdk.jpg" alt="pix/xdk.jpg"></div>

   <p>The logo expresses the extensibility of XDG, and the building of grammars
like with lego blocks, by stacking the three acronym letters on each
other. This is also a hint to the multiple levels/dimensions that XDG
grammars can have. Well, that's what I interpret :-)

   <p>Version 1.5.3 (November 28, 2006)

   <p>Added hooks for the FD, FS and Select functors. Now, by choosing the
print option in the GUI, all the propagators which are normally posted
can now be printed out to stdout (and not posted). This is the first
step in the transition to the new Gecode constraint engine, which
Guido Tack and me are now undertaking. The very idea to simply flatly
print out the propagators is due to Gert Smolka.

   <p>Transformed principle constraints such that all infixed FD
constraints, e.g. <code>=:</code> or <code>=&lt;:</code> are now prefixed, using the
appropriate prefixed equivalents.

   <p>Fixed a bug in <code>Extras/SolvingStatistics.oz</code> which would raise an
unhandled error whenever a word in the input was not in the lexicon of
the grammar.

   <p>Removed grammar <code>Grammars/TAG-wwRwwR.ul</code>.

   <p>Fixed small bugs in some of the grammars/examples files.

   <p>Version 1.5.2 (October 25, 2006)

   <p>Changed defaults for the order principles: now, the argument variables
<code>Projective</code> and <code>Yields</code> have default <code>false</code> instead
of <code>true</code>. Makes the principles more intuitive to use (I had
wondered why the hell switching off the projectivity principle would
not give me the overgeneration I expected in <code>Grammars/ANBN.ul</code>).

   <p>Version 1.5.1 (September 14, 2006)

   <p>Updated the manual to reflect all the new stuff in the XDK, especially
the new principles.

   <p>Lots of fixes around the socket functionality of <code>xdk.exe</code> and
<code>xdks.exe</code>, and in particular solving statistics. Solving
statistics would not work at all with grammars coming from a socket
etc.

   <p>Most important news: now, the XDK supports the English TAG grammar
developed in the XTAG project
(<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~xtag/</a>).  This is the first real
large-scale grammar for the XDK, which will allow us to improve the
system, see where its bottlenecks are etc. The XTAG grammar generator
module of the XDK is described in <a href="XTAG.html#XTAG">XTAG</a>.

   <p>The generated grammars make use of three new principles:
     <ul>
<li><code>principle.xTAG</code> (<a href="XTAG1.html#XTAG1">XTAG1</a>)
<li><code>principle.xTAGRedundant</code> (<a href="XTAGRedundant.html#XTAGRedundant">XTAGRedundant</a>)
<li><code>principle.xTAGRoot</code> (<a href="XTAGRoot.html#XTAGRoot">XTAGRoot</a>)
</ul>

   <p>And the new output <code>output.xTAGDerivation</code> (<a href="XTAGDerivation.html#XTAGDerivation">XTAGDerivation</a>)
to display XTAG derivation trees using the tree viewer from the XTAG
project lem parser.

   <p>The function &ldquo;Compare lem solutions&rdquo; in <code>xdk.exe</code> compares the
derivation trees obtained from the encoded XDG grammar with the
derivation trees obtained from the lem parser.

   <p>Version 1.5.0 (September 1, 2006)

   <p>Added support for the XTAG grammar. Soon to be documented :)

   <p>Version 1.4.11 (August 18, 2006)

   <p>Added Selection constraint to the XDK package since the Select package
would not individually compile under Mozart 1.3.2 anymore :( Makes the
installation of the XDK simpler anyway :)

   <p>Version 1.4.10 (July 27, 2006)

   <p>Fixed <code>principle.linkingEndNDG</code> and changed the constraint in
<code>principle.linkingEnd</code> accordingly.

   <p>Version 1.4.9 (July 26, 2006)

   <p>Added principle <code>principle.sameEdges</code>.

   <p>Renamed <code>principle.sameorder</code> to <code>principle.sameOrder</code> (used
only in <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>, <code>Grammars/dissNDG.ul</code> and
<code>Grammars/igk.ul</code>).

   <p>Added new output functor <code>output.pretty1</code> for better comparison
of solutions.

   <p>Version 1.4.8 (July 18, 2006)

   <p>Recompiled binaries using the new Mozart 1.3.2.

   <p>Changed Diplom grammar (<code>Grammars/Diplom.ul</code>) such that it does
not use the deprecated <code>principle.nodeconstraints</code> and
<code>principle.edgeconstraints</code> principles anymore but instead
<code>principle.agr</code>, <code>principle.agreement</code>,
<code>principle.government</code> and the new
<code>principle.agreementSubset</code> principles.

   <p>Added new versions of all principles using edge constraints with the
crucial difference that they do not use deep guards. The new versions
are suffixed with <code>NDG</code> ("no deep guards"). Here are the
principles:
     <ul>
<li><code>principle.agreementNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.agreementSubsetNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.coindexNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.copynpasteNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.governmentNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.graph1ConstraintsNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.graph1NDG</code>
<li><code>principle.graphConstraintsNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.graphNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linking12BelowStartEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingAboveNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingAboveBelow1or2StartNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingAboveEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingAboveStartNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingAboveStartEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingBelowNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingBelow1or2StartNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingBelowEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingBelowStartNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingBelowStartEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingDaughterNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingDaughterEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingMotherNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingMotherEndNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingNotDaughterNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingNotMotherNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.linkingSistersNDG</code>
<li><code>principle.partialAgreementNDG</code>
</ul>

   <p>Added new grammars using the new principle versions:
     <ul>
<li><code>DiplomNDG.ul</code>
<li><code>coindexNDG.ul</code>
<li><code>dissNDG.ul</code>
<li><code>wwNDG.ul</code>
<li><code>wwRNDG.ul</code>
<li><code>wwRwwRNDG.ul</code>
</ul>

   <p>Version 1.4.7 (May 9, 2006)

   <p>Fixed install scripts, removed grammar <code>Grammars/MOZ04.ul</code>.

   <p>Added new version of <code>xdag.sty</code> improved by Robert Grabowski.

   <p>Version 1.4.6 (April 20, 2006)

   <p>Added third dimension variable to multidimensional principles which
can be parametrized lexically to more closely reflect the principle
definitions in the thesis.

   <p>Version 1.4.5 (April 19, 2006)

   <p>Updated <code>Grammars/SAT.ul</code> to properly reflect the grammar in the
complexity chapter of the thesis.

   <p>Added grammar files to online versions of the manual.

   <p>Added principle constraint functors to online versions of the manual.

   <p>Changed name (to maintain consistency with the diss):
<em>mapping/map types</em> are now called <em>vectors</em>. That is, in
UL, <code>map(T1 T2)</code> becomes <code>vec(T1 T2)</code>, in IL,
<code>type.map</code> becomes <code>type.vec</code>, and in XML, <code>typeMap</code>
becomes <code>typeVec</code>.

   <p>Renamed <em>disjunctive domains</em> to <code>unions</code>. In IL,
<code>type.disj</code> becomes <code>type.union</code>, and in XML,
<code>typeDisj</code> becomes <code>typeUnion</code>.

   <p>Version 1.4.4 (April 5, 2006)

   <p>Added first support for partial specification of the solutions before
parsing. Each input string can now be extended with file names which
contain partial descriptions of sets of nodes, which will be type
checked and then used as additional information in the solver. For
example, using the grammar <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>, parsing the
sentence:

<pre class="example">     mary_L+H*_LH% sees the man with a telescope_H*_LL% . Grammars/diss.nodeset.xml
</pre>
   <p>leads to the addition of the additional information in
<code>Grammars/diss.nodeset.xml</code>

   <p>This functionality supports all file types (except precompiled
grammars) also available for writing grammars, i.e., UL (suffix
<code>ul</code>), XML (<code>xml</code>) or IL (<code>ilp</code> for pickles or
<code>ozf</code> for functors exporting <code>set</code>). XML sockets are also
supported (<code>xmlsocket</code>).

   <p>Improved <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code> on the id dimension (no distinction
between <code>padv</code> and <code>padj</code>), new names for prepositions.

   <p>Version 1.4.3 (April 3, 2006)

   <p>Updated manual to reflect the latest changes, removed some obsolete
grammars and principles, added the recent papers etc.

   <p>Version 1.4.2 (March 31, 2006)

   <p>Improved <code>Decode</code> output functor to show only the dimension on
which it is used.

   <p>New output functors <code>AllDags1</code>, <code>AllDags2</code>, <code>AllDags3</code>
and <code>AllDags4</code>: show all dags of the multigraph, also those
without edges. This is especially useful if interface dimensions (such
as idlp etc.) are defined and you would like to see the node record of
a node for this dimension.

   <p>Similarly, added new output functors <code>AllLatexs1</code>, <code>AllLatexs2</code>,
<code>AllLatexs3</code> and <code>AllLatexs4</code>.

   <p>New principles <code>principle.linkingAboveBelow1or2Start</code>,
<code>principle.lockingDaughters</code>.

   <p>Lots of changes in <code>diss1.ul</code>. Still improved syntax-semantics
interface.

   <p>Added progress "report" for grammar compilation (too useful to be just
debugging output).

   <p>Version 1.4.1 (March 18, 2006)

   <p>New grammar <code>diss1.ul</code> using the new lexicalized order principle
<code>principle.order3</code> instead of the old one. Surprisingly good
propagation (better than the old non-lexicalized one!).

   <p>New principle <code>principle.projectivity1</code> enforcing convex <code>yield</code>
sets instead of <code>eqdown</code> sets as <code>principle.projectivity</code>.

   <p>Removed <code>Projectivity</code> argument variable and projectivity
constraint from <code>principle.order3</code> (use
<code>principle.projectivity1</code> instead please) to bring the principle
more in line with the formalization in the thesis.

   <p>Improved principles and outputs menus in GUI <code>xdk.exe</code>: now they
are ordered by dimension.

   <p>Improved latex output functors: now, the index/position of each node
is also displayed alongside the word.

   <p>Important! Changed the type of the constraint functors, replacing the
two arguments <code>DVA2DIDA</code> and <code>ArgRecProc</code> with the argument
<code>Principle</code> standing for the instance of the principle in whose
context the constraint functor is called. The advantage is that more
of the information attached to the principle instance is then
available to the constraint functors, including the type of its
arguments. The (cosmetic) drawback is that the two functions
<code>DVA2DIDA</code> and <code>ArgRecProc</code> must now be dereferenced from
<code>Principle</code> first.

   <p>Adapted all principles in the principle library to these new
conventions.

   <p>Adapted the manual to reflect the conventions <a href="Writing-new-principles.html#Writing-new-principles">Writing new principles</a>.

   <p>Added new principle <code>principle.partialAgreement</code> to handle
partial agreement in a generalized way. This principle is used in the
new thesis grammar <code>diss1.ul</code> to establish partial agreement of
relative pronouns with their modified nouns (with respect to gender).

   <p>Enhanced <code>xdag.sty</code> with new command <code>penode</code> for
parametrized nodes with an extra node label, which can be freely
positioned (done together with Robert Grabowski).

   <p>Enhanced <code>xdag.sty</code> for better support for "ghosting" nodes and
edges instead of just omitting them.

   <p>Changed <code>Dag</code> and <code>Latex</code> output functors to "ghost" nodes
and edges instead of just omitting them.

   <p>Version 1.4.0 (March 2, 2006)

   <p>Added disjunctive domain types as syntactic sugar for combining domain
types. Useful for the new lexicalized order principle
<code>principle.order3</code>, which is formulated on top of a strict total
order on the set of edge labels plus the special label <code>"^"</code>. 
can be now written down as:
<pre class="example">       deftype "syn.label" {root subj part obj vinf adv}
       deftype "syn.label1" "syn.label" | {"^"}
       defentrytype {...
                     order: set(tuple("syn.label1" "syn.label1"))
                     ...}
</pre>
   <p>Adapted the thesis grammars <code>nut.ul</code>, <code>nut1.ul</code>,
<code>ANBN.ul</code>, <code>ANBNCN.ul</code>, <code>CSD.ul</code>, <code>SCR.ul</code> and
<code>SAT.ul</code> to reflect this new syntactic sugar.

   <p>Adapted the manual (descriptions of UL, XML and IL syntax) to reflect
the new syntactic sugar.

   <p>Improvements to the scripts <code>code2pic</code>, <code>ozcolor</code>,
<code>ulcolor</code> and <code>xmlcolor</code>.

   <p>Improved the principles <code>principle.order3</code>,
<code>principle.order3Constraints</code> and <code>principle.order3Dist</code>.

   <p>Fixed the principle <code>BarriersAttrib</code> (used wrong syntax for type
variables).

   <p>Made the domain types &ldquo;position insensitive&rdquo; by sorting the atoms
lexically (using Mozart's <code>Value.'&lt;'</code>) of a domain 1) before type
checking (<code>TypeCollector.oz</code>), and 2) when creating lattice
functor ADTs (<code>Domain.oz</code>).

   <p>Added 100 to the priority of all principles to stay in accord with the
formalization given in the thesis. Now, constraints with priority
higher than 100 are started first, then come the edge constraints with
priority 100, and then the remaining constraints with priority less
than 100 (currently, only distribution).

   <p>Version 1.3.24 (February 24, 2006)

   <p>New output functor <code>output.decode</code> for displaying solutions in
the Intermediate Language. This was already possible using the Inspect
action from the Explorer, but its output could not be redirected
e.g. into the Oz Browser for copy and paste.

   <p>Improved generation of orderings, now an arbitrary ordered dimension
can be selected (was restricted to <code>lp</code>).

   <p>Various improvements to the scripts <code>code2pic</code>, <code>ozcolor</code>,
<code>ulcolor</code> and <code>xmlcolor</code>.

   <p>Version 1.3.23 (February 21, 2006)

   <p>Added new principle <code>principle.order3</code>, which implements the
order principle in the thesis. Used in the diss grammars
<code>nut.ul</code>, <code>nut1.ul</code>, <code>EQAB.ul</code>, <code>ANBN.ul</code>,
<code>ANBNCN.ul</code>, <code>CSD.ul</code>, <code>SCR.ul</code> and <code>SAT.ul</code>.

   <p>Merged scripts <code>oz2eps</code>, <code>oz2pdf</code>, <code>oz2jpg</code>,
<code>oz2epsn</code>, <code>oz2pdfn</code>, <code>oz2jpgn</code>, <code>ul2eps</code>,
<code>ul2pdf</code>, <code>ul2jpg</code>, <code>ul2epsn</code>, <code>ul2pdfn</code>,
<code>ul2jpgn</code> into one script <code>code2pic</code>.

   <p>Added support for XML source code highlighting (<code>xmlcolor</code>). 
Merged that into <code>code2pic</code> as well.

   <p>Version 1.3.22 (February 7, 2006)

   <p>Manual: Improved section <a href="UL-syntax.html#UL-syntax">UL syntax</a> (e.g. didn't list the new
abbreviations for type reference and class reference).

   <p>Improved type checker: didn't check for ambiguous set generator expressions
due to doubly occurring constants in the corresponding domains.

   <p>Improved <code>xdag.sty</code>: added commands <code>pnode</code> (parametrized
node) and <code>rednode</code> (red node). The latter draws the node in red,
and the former has an additional argument for pstricks parameters,
e.g. to magically remove nodes from sight using the parameter
<code>linecolor=white</code>.

   <p>Cleaned up the <code>Grammars</code> directory. Need to update the manual to
reflect this still.

   <p>Added new scripts <code>oz2eps</code>, <code>oz2pdf</code>, <code>oz2jpg</code>,
<code>oz2epsn</code>, <code>oz2pdfn</code>, <code>oz2jpgn</code>, <code>ul2eps</code>,
<code>ul2pdf</code>, <code>ul2jpg</code>, <code>ul2epsn</code>, <code>ul2pdfn</code>,
<code>ul2jpgn</code> for source code highlighting in LaTeX (for the thesis).

   <p>Version 1.3.21 (Feburary 3, 2006)

   <p>Improved the new example grammars to match better with the thesis,
e.g., using the new principle <code>principle.order2</code> instead of the
old one (<code>principle.order</code>). It is less efficient, but has better
support for lexicalization.

   <p>Added new script <code>ozcolor</code> to do Oz-source code coloring.

   <p>Fixed a small bug in the GUI ("Solve Examples").

   <p>Bumped copyrights to 2006.

   <p>Version 1.3.20 (January 6, 2006)

   <p>Added stuff written to support the thesis: new grammars <code>csd.ul</code>
(cross-serial dependencies) <code>scr.ul</code> (scrambling), new principle
<code>principle.csd</code>.

   <p>Version 1.3.19 (December 23, 2005)

   <p>better support for graphs with cycles: principles fixed
(<code>principle.graph</code>, <code>principle.order</code>), dag output functor
improved (though by far not perfect yet).

   <p>Version 1.3.18 (December 16, 2005)

   <p>Experimental version for Bertrand :)

   <p>Version 1.3.17 (September 30, 2005)

   <p>Renamed <code>principle.poetry</code> to <code>principle.coindex</code>,
and <code>poetry.ul</code> to <code>coindex.ul</code>.

   <p>Completely rewrote <code>Grammars/pl.ul</code> and <code>principle.pl</code>
(former version would not take care of coreferent variables).

   <p>Version 1.3.16 (September 12, 2005)

   <p>More improvements to <code>NewTkDag.oz</code>.

   <p>Changed the underlying finite domain for the type <code>bool</code>
(<a href="Bool.html#Bool">Bool</a>), which used to encode <code>true</code> as <code>1</code> and
<code>false</code> as <code>2</code>. Now encodes <code>false</code> as <code>1</code> and
<code>true</code> as <code>2</code>, so that subtracting one gives the right truth
value for reified constraints in Mozart (<code>0</code> for <code>false</code> and
<code>1</code> for <code>true</code>). Adapted the constraints in the
principle library
to reflect this:
     <ul>
<li><code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Climbing.oz</code>,
<li><code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Dag.oz</code>
<li><code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Order1Conditions.oz</code>
<li><code>Solver/Principles/Lib/Order2Conditions.oz</code>
<li><code>Solver/Principles/Lib/OrderConditions.oz</code>
</ul>

   <p>Added new grammar <code>Grammars/pl.ul</code> and new principle
<code>principle.pl</code>. This is a grammar for propositional logic, where
you can enter propositional formulae as sentences, and the XDK
enumerates the solutions.

   <p>Version 1.3.15 (September 12, 2005)

   <p>Added new <code>NewTkDag.oz</code> functor for Tcl/Tk dag output which tries
to move around edge labels if they overlap. Still experimental, please
write email if it does not do the right thing for you!

   <p>Version 1.3.14 (September 6, 2005)

   <p>Added revised grammar <code>Grammars/MOZ04.ul</code> again, since the
grammar in the corresponding paper does not work with the new XDK
anymore.

   <p>Fixed biiig bug in profiler: the profiler multiplied the lexical entry
variables and propagators introduced per node with the number of
entries for that node, which was wrong and resulted in way too many
variables and propagators counted...

   <p>Added combined count of finite domain and finite set variables to
profiler (called <code>fdfs</code>). Also adapted the DTD
<code>Extras/statistics.dtd</code> to reflect this.

   <p>Version 1.3.13 (August 23, 2005)

   <p>Fixed <code>Compiler/Lattices/Tuple.oz</code>: function <code>as2I</code> would
return an integer one short. This had repurcussions in
<code>Compiler/Lattices/Set.oz</code>, and in
<code>Solver/Principles/Order2Conditions.oz</code>.

   <p>Added new principles <code>principle.barriers.attrib</code> and
<code>principle.barriers.labels</code> contributed by Denys Duchier.

   <p>Added new experimental principle <code>principle.poetry</code> which
realizes our first ideas on how to handle FB-LTAG features, and an
accompanying example grammar <code>Grammars/poetry.ul</code>.

   <p>Version 1.3.12 (June 30, 2005)

   <p>Added new principle <code>principle.government2</code> which allows to
govern a feature of the daughter of the daughter of a node (e.g.  the
verb can now govern the noun under the preposition depending on the
verb...).

   <p>Version 1.3.11 (June 15, 2005)

   <p>Fixed bug in the Dag functor diff functionality.

   <p>More enhancements to the <code>diss.ul</code> grammar.

   <p>Added output functor <code>output.clls1</code> which just prints out the
CLLS constraint obtained from e.g. <code>diss.ul</code> without drawing it
using daVinci.

   <p>Version 1.3.10 (May 23, 2005)

   <p>Augmented <code>diss.ul</code> grammar with personal pronouns, perfect
constructions and additional lexical entries.

   <p>Version 1.3.9 (May 20, 2005)

   <p>Added code to enable the use of disjunction for features (e.g. 
important for valencies).

   <p>Version 1.3.8 (May 13, 2005)

   <p>Dynamic grammar loading via sockets works now :)

   <p>You can now run a server which awaits client connections from the XDK. 
To make the XDK establish a client connection, attempt to load
grammars with suffix <code>xmlsocket</code>,
e.g. <code>4712.xmlsocket</code>. This makes the XDK try to establish a
connection with a grammar server on port 4712. For each parse, the XDK
client now sends a message containing the sentence to be parsed (as a
string) to the server, and expects the server to return a grammar for
this sentence, which is then used for parsing.

   <p>Bumped copyrights to 2005.

   <p>Version 1.3.7 (May 11, 2005)

   <p>Added experimental support for dynamic grammar loading via sockets,
to be finished in 1.4.0.

   <p>Changed example grammars such that the outputs are used and
chosen on the lex dimension instead of the multi dimension.

   <p>Changed Dag(s) and Latex(s) output functors: <code>conj</code> and
<code>pred</code> edges (emanating from the root) are not left out anymore.

   <p>Version 1.3.6 (April 27, 2005)

   <p>Fixed <code>Order</code> and <code>Order1</code> principles to support
lexicalization (even though this is not recommended...).

   <p>Added more information to the debugging section.

   <p>Version 1.3.5 (April 11, 2005)

   <p>In debugging mode, the grammar file compiler now prints out the names
of the unused lexical classes.

   <p>Improved <code>xdag2eps</code>, <code>xdag2pdf</code> and <code>xdag2jpg</code> to cope
with input files in other directories than the current one.

   <p>Further improvements to the dissertation grammar.

   <p>Version 1.3.4 (April 9, 2005)

   <p>Added new syntactic sugar for generating order relations. In the UL, you
can write e.g. <code>&lt;a b c&gt;</code> for the order relation <code>{[a b] [a c]
[b c]}</code>. This only works if the type of the expression is a set of
pairs of the same type.

   <p>New experimental principles <code>Order2</code> (constraint functor
<code>Order2Conditions</code>), <code>Order2Constraints</code> and
<code>Order2Dist</code>.

   <p>Improved the XML language to deal with variable features, cf. the
example grammar <code>Grammars/Acl01.xml</code>. Important: if you use
parametrized lexical classes, please change your XML output and use
<code>varFeature</code> instead of <code>feature</code> when instantiating the
parameters of a lexical class.

   <p>Lots of improvements to the dissertation grammar.

   <p>Version 1.3.3 (April 7, 2005)

   <p>Many more improvements to grammar <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>.

   <p>New principle <code>LinkingDaughter1Above2</code>. Kind of like parametrized
climbing.

   <p>Made new principle <code>Locking</code> more general.

   <p>Updated <code>diffnotime</code> to also exclude the date when comparing.

   <p>Added &ldquo;proportional&rdquo; Dag output: now each node has its own width, as
opposed to the maximum width. Improves usability a lot.

   <p>Version 1.3.2 (April 6, 2005)

   <p>New principle <code>Locking</code>.

   <p>Heavily improved grammar <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>, now using the new
locking principle for a much cleaner syntax-semantics interface
(idpa).

   <p>Renamed <code>principle.linkingSubgraphs</code> to
<code>principle.subgraphs</code>.

   <p>Renamed <code>principle.graphExceptDist</code> to
<code>principle.graphConstraints</code>, <code>principle.graph1ExceptDist</code>
to <code>principle.graph1Constraints</code>, <code>principle.graphOnlyDist</code>
to <code>principle.graphDist</code>, <code>principle.graph1OnlyDist</code> to to
<code>principle.graph1Dist</code>, <code>principle.orderExceptDist</code> to
<code>principle.orderConstraints</code>, <code>principle.order1ExceptDist</code>
to <code>principle.order1Constraints</code>, <code>principle.orderOnlyDist</code>
to <code>principle.orderDist</code>, and <code>principle.order1OnlyDist</code> to
<code>principle.order1Dist</code>.

   <p>Version 1.3.2 (April 6, 2005)

   <p>Updated description of the LaTeX output.

   <p>Removed <code>Grammars/scatter.ul</code> and
<code>Grammars/scatter_wwRwwR.ul</code>, <code>Gapfilling</code> and
<code>OrderGap</code> principles again.

   <p>Added new grammar <code>Grammars/diss.ul</code>, combining
<code>Grammars/Chorus.ul</code> (syntax-semantics interface) and
<code>Grammars/igk.ul</code> (information structure) which I have been
written for my dissertation.

   <p>Updated the Dag output functors to check whether node labels have
changed from one analysis to another. Very useful if you just cannot
see a difference between two analyses (now you can).

   <p>New principle <code>Linking2BelowStart</code>.

   <p>Version 1.3.1 (March 30, 2005)

   <p>Fixed a bug in the Tcl/Tk dag output which would cause the Explorer to
hang, at least under Win XP.

   <p>Version 1.3.0 (March 28, 2005)

   <p>Significant improvement to the type checker: removed the &ldquo;any&rdquo; type,
and introduced type variables for principle arguments: each principle
can introduce a set of type variables for its arguments, and these can
be instantiated by either feature paths or type annotations.

   <p>Numerous other bugfixes.

   <p>Version 1.2.4 (March 21, 2005)

   <p>Small changes to the solving statistics.

   <p>Bugfix for passives in <code>Chorus.ul</code>.

   <p>Version 1.2.3 (March 20, 2005)

   <p>Fixed a nasty bug causing the grammar file compiler to hang in case a
graph principle was used on a dimension with an empty set of edge
labels.

   <p>Version 1.2.2 (March 18, 2005)

   <p>Removed <code>xdkcount.exe</code> again and folded its functionality into
the solving statistics. This also yielded additions in
<code>Extras/statistics.dtd</code>.

   <p>Changed default for adding profiling information to solving statistics
(now on), applies to <code>xdk.exe</code> and <code>xdks.exe</code>.

   <p>Version 1.2.1 (March 16, 2005)

   <p>Small changes in the XML output for solving statistics (tag
<code>solution</code> renamed to <code>string</code>).

   <p>Fixed bug in <code>scripts/addprinciple</code>, <code>scripts/mvprinciple</code>
and <code>scripts/rmprinciple</code> (occurred when changing the toplevel
<code>makefile.oz</code>), and added some nice output to the scripts telling
the user what they are doing.

   <p>Ported relative clause principle (for <code>Grammars/Diplom.ul</code>) from
old TDG parser.

   <p>Optimized propagation of the Dag/Tree functors.

   <p>Added propagators introduced by the <code>Edge.oz</code> edge constraint
functor to the profiling.

   <p>Added solving statistics tool <code>xdkcount.exe</code>.

   <p>Version 1.2.0 (March 14, 2005)

   <p>Added profiling support for counting the additional variables
introduced by the constraint functors, and the propagators
they introduce. This involved the following changes:
     <ul>
<li>added procedure <code>Profile</code> to all constraint functors
(except <code>NodeConstraints.oz</code> and <code>EdgeConstraints.oz</code> which
are quickly becoming obsolete anyway). The procedure (manually) counts
the additional variables (in addition to the variables introduced in
the node record) and the propagators. 
<li>added lots of additional code to <code>Extras/Profile.oz</code>
<li>changed the solving statistics (functor: <code>Extras/SolvingStatistics.oz</code>
to reflect the changes in the profiling functor
</ul>

   <p>Notice: the grammar format for compiled grammars changes with this
version, so please recompile your grammars if you have any. Sorry for
any inconveniences caused.

   <p>Version 1.1.4 (March 9, 2005)

   <p>Removed hardcoded <code>multi</code> dimension (and mapping from dimension
variable <code>Multi</code> to <code>multi</code>).

   <p>Added mapping from dimension variable <code>This</code> to the dimension id
of the currently defined dimension.

   <p>Version 1.1.3

   <p>Added perl-scripts for adding/removing/renaming principles and
accompanying constraints: <code>scripts/addprinciple</code>,
<code>scripts/rmprinciple</code> and <code>scripts/mvprinciple</code>. Should ease
the tedious addition/removal/renaming of principles.

   <p>Updated parameter names for the linking principles according to the
current thesis version.

   <p>Renamed <code>principle.linkingBelow12StartEnd</code> principle to
<code>principle.linking12BelowStartEnd</code>.

   <p>Added <code>principle.linkingBelow1Start1End2</code> principle, and grammar
<code>Grammars/ESSLLI04_idlppasc.ul</code> (without deep syntax, instead
slightly more complicated linking via the above new principle).

   <p>Version 1.1.2

   <p>Fixed small bug in <code>xdk.oz</code> which hit when you switched off a
dimension, called Generate Orderings, and then selected "Outputs" for
one of the analyses.

   <p>Version 1.1.1

   <p>Added script <code>scripts/xdag2jpg</code> to convert LaTeX-output
dependency graphs into JPG. This is very useful for those notorious
applications which do not support EPS/JPG image import, most notably,
Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint) and OpenOffice.

   <p>Version 1.1.0

   <p>Totally re-organized the linking/dominance principles according to
their formalizations in my thesis, making it a lot more systematic
than before. Now, it should be much clearer which principle does what,
and when to use which and so on.

   <p>The re-organization has led to the following changes:
     <ul>
<li>replaced <code>principle.linking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingEnd</code>,
<li>replaced <code>principle.directcolinking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingDaughterEnd</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.directcontralinking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingMotherEnd</code>
<li>split <code>principle.immediate</code> into
<code>principle.linkingDaughter</code> (co-immediate) and
<code>principle.linkingMother</code> (contra-immediate)
<li>split <code>principle.notImmediate</code> into
<code>principle.linkingNotDaughter</code> (co-not-immediate) and
<code>principle.linkingNotMother</code> (contra-not-immediate)
<li>split <code>principle.dominance</code> into
<code>principle.linkingBelow</code> (co-dominance) and
<code>principle.linkingAbove</code> (contra-dominance)
<li>split <code>principle.ldominance</code> into
<code>principle.linkingBelowStart</code> (l-co-dominance) and
<code>principle.linkingAboveEnd</code> (l-contra-dominance)
<li>added <code>principle.linkingBelowEnd</code> and
<code>principle.linkingAboveStart</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.colinking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingBelowStartEnd</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.contralinking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingAboveStartEnd</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.dominance1</code> by
<code>principle.chorus</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.sisters</code> by
<code>principle.linkingSisters</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.sublinking</code> by
<code>principle.linkingSubgraphs</code>
<li>replaced <code>principle.colinking1</code> by
<code>principle.linkingBelow12StartEnd</code>
</ul>
   Please also notice, that the features of the principles are different,
as are their defaults.  Please check the principles list
(<a href="Principles-list.html#Principles-list">Principles list</a>) to adapt your grammars, and do not hesitate to
ask me if any problems occur. Sorry in advance for any inconveniences
this may cause.

   <p>This renovation affected the principle library of course, the grammars
(I adapted all grammars in <code>Grammars/</code> to reflect the changes),
Ondrej's PDT grammar generation code (I have adapted that as well) and
the manual. VAST changes to do, but hopefully not very difficult to
adapt to for you users.

   <p>The debug output at grammar compilation stage
(<code>Compiler/Encoder.oz</code>) is now more informative: it prints out
the number of actual lexical entries stored in the compiled out
grammar.

   <p>Version 1.0.6

   <p>Heavily improved the type system according to what I write in my
upcoming thesis:
     <ul>
<li>added new type <code>card</code> for cardinalities, and the corresponding
lattice functor <code>Card.oz</code>
<li>removed the superfluous <code>Map.oz</code> lattice functor, its
work was already done by <code>Record.oz</code>
<li>removed the <code>Valency.oz</code> lattice functor, its work is
now done by <code>Record.oz</code> and <code>Card.oz</code>
<li>removed the following <code>Ints.oz</code> lattice functor, and pushed
its functionality into the set lattice functor <code>Set.oz</code> (sub
lattice <code>intSet</code>)
</ul>

   <p>The result is a cleaner and leaner type checker. This also fixed some
bugs in the type system which were due to the slightly faulty design. 
E.g. it was impossible to write down sets of integers so far. And it
was possible to write down valency sets which were no sets.

   <p>I guess I could have introduced some new bugs though, since I
undertook quite a lot of changes. Please test your stuff and report
any new errors, or even unusable error messages etc.

   <p>Version 1.0.5

   <p>Removed the non-monotonic behavior of the greatest lower bound (glb)
operations of strings and lists. Now, all glb operations are
commutative again.

   <p>The result of the prior change is that lists cannot be concatenated
anymore. Since nobody has actually ever used this functionality, this
should not come as a big loss.

   <p>Strings on the other hand still can: I introduced an explicit
concatenation operator (<code>@</code> in the UL, <code>&lt;concat&gt;</code> in the
XML language). An example of how to use this can be found in
<code>Grammars/igk.ul</code>.

   <p>These changes make the XDK cleaner, and more similar to the actual
formalization which I am currently working out for my thesis.

   <p>Version 1.0.4

   <p>Added new experimental TAG-encoding grammars
<code>Grammars/scatter.ul</code> and <code>Grammars/scatter_wwRwwR.ul</code>.

   <p>Added new experimental principles <code>Gapfilling</code> and
<code>OrderGap</code> to accompany the two grammars above.

   <p>Added window resizing functionality to the ManualOracle-code, and
fixed a bug there.

   <p>Version 1.0.3

   <p>Slightly optimized the propagation behavior of the Order and Climbing
principles.

   <p>The Climbing principle is now parametrizable. Attention if you use the
climbing principle on dimensions which are not trees: you must now
explicitly set the parameter <code>MotherCards</code> to <code>false</code> in
this case to turn off an optimization restricted to trees.

   <p>Version 1.0.2

   <p>Added automatic resizing of Dag output windows to fit on the screen, e.g. 
to make MacOS X users' life easier 8-) This was also pointed out by Mark,
thanks again!

   <p>Added version information to the About window in the
<code>xdk</code>-executable.

   <p>Version 1.0.1

   <p>Set/DomainTupleSet could not encode sets but only set generators. Fixed. 
Pointed out by Mark Pedersen, thanks!

   <p>Re-added <code>duchier-select.pkg</code> and the native functor object files
(<code>*.o</code>) to the Windows binary distribution in order to be able to
compile it using ozmake.

   <p>Version 1.0.0

   <p>It's done!

   <p>Version 0.9.16

   <p>Changed shortcut for <code>--port</code> (in <code>xdg</code> and
<code>Oracles/ManualOracle/Server.exe</code>) from <code>-t</code> to <code>-p</code>.

   <p>Made profiling optional for parse statistics.

   <p>Added commandline option <code>--(no)profile</code> (<code>-f</code>) to toggle
profiling in the <code>xdk</code> and <code>xdks</code> programs.

   <p>Added menu checkbutton <code>Profile</code> to the <code>xdk</code> program.

   <p>Made <code>gprofile</code> and <code>sprofile</code> elements optional in
<code>Extras/statistics.dtd</code>.

   <p>Renamed <code>sentence</code> element to <code>solution</code> again.

   <p>Version 0.9.15

   <p>Added new profiling functionality: the counting of fd/fs variables
introduced. This involved changes in the lattice functor
implementation in <code>Compiler/Lattices</code> (added a new function
<code>Count</code> to each lattice).

   <p>This is also used in the new solving statistics output, and thus, I
changed the DTD (<code>Extras/statistics.dtd</code>):
     <ul>
<li>the <code>statistics</code> element has now a new obligatory daughter
element <code>gprofile</code> (grammar profile)
<li>I renamed the <code>solution</code> element to <code>sentence</code> (which
makes more sense)
<li>this <code>sentence</code> element has now a new obligatory daughter
element <code>sprofile</code> (sentence profile)
</ul>

   <p>Further improvements in the manual (types, lattices, lattice
functors).

   <p>Version 0.9.14

   <p>Updated the parts of the manual pertaining to 1) the grammars, 2) the
outputs, and 3) the principles. Especially the latter is now much
better and contains much more comprehensible explanations of the
principles and their behaviors.

   <p>Version 0.9.13

   <p>Added <code>principle.sameorder</code> to equate the positions on ordered
dimensions.

   <p>Added boolean parameter <code>Yields</code> to the order principles (true by
default). If true, the yields of a node are ordered, if false, the
daughters.

   <p>Version 0.9.12

   <p>Renamed XDK executables for consistency: xdg -&gt; xdk, xdgc -&gt; xdkc,
xdgs -&gt; xdks and xdgconv -&gt; xdkconv.

   <p>Version 0.9.11

   <p>Added check for undefined values in lexical entries (throws an
exception if so). Quite optimized so&mdash;only those features which
<em>can</em> be undefined at all.

   <p>Added same check for undefined values also for principle arguments
(except for constraint arguments which are not checked, too much
effort for too little gain, IMHO).

   <p>Version 0.9.10

   <p>Made the order of the dimensions more consistent (always
alphabetically ordered now), e.g. in the GUI menus and in the Dags
output functors.

   <p>Increased the associativity strength of the conjunction (<code>&amp;</code>) and
disjunction (<code>|</code>) operators in the UL to make for less
bracketing.

   <p>Changed the behavior of the List and String types. Their top value is
now resp. the empty list and the empty string (instead of, as before,
being undefined), and their greatest lower bound is now the
concatenation of resp. the two lists and strings under consideration
(instead of, as before, bottom if the two were different and none of
them was the top value). I.e. now you can even do some simple
morphology in the XDG lexicon.

   <p>The Dag and Latex output functor families behave more consistently.

   <p>Latex functor now escapes LaTeX special characters properly (<code>$</code>,
<code>&amp;</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>#</code>, <code>_</code>, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code>, <code>~</code>,
<code>^</code>, <code>\</code>).

   <p>New Latex, Latex1, Latex2, Latex3 output functors for individual
dimensions (corresponding to Dag, Dag1, ...).

   <p>New Latexs, Latexs1, Latexs2, Latexs3 output functors for multiple
dimensions (corresponding to Latex, Latex1, ...).

   <p>Improved xdag2eps, xdag2pdf.

   <p>Added ulcolor script (uses LaTeX color package to do UL code highlighting).

   <p>Added big new German grammar done by Regine Bader, Christine Foeldesi,
Ulrich Pfeiffer and Jochen Steigner (building on my Diplom grammar).

   <p>Added Benoit Crabbe's first version of his French grammar (Benoit.ul).

   <p>Added the first attempt to handle Information Structure (igk.ul) done at
the IGK annual meeting in Edinburgh (Ciprian Gerstenberger, Oana
Postolache, Stefan Thater and Maarika Traat).

   <p>Put all scripts in a separate directory (<code>scripts</code>).

   <p>And many many more improvements.

   <p>Version 0.9.8

   <p>Introduced the multi dimension
<a name="index-multi-342"></a><a name="index-multi-dimension-343"></a>for collecting multi-dimensional principles, corresponding lexical
attributes, and outputs, in addition to the lex dimension. 
<a name="index-lex-344"></a><a name="index-lex-dimension-345"></a>
Added ESSLLI 2004 example grammars, removed COLING04 and DG04
grammars, updated Chorus grammar.

   <p>Added French example grammar by Benoit Crabbe.

   <p>New principles: CoLinking, CoLinking1 and ContraLinking

   <p>Lots of additional fixes and stuff.

   <p>Version 0.9.7

   <p>Renamed <code>latex2eps</code> to <code>xdag2eps</code>, and also <code>latex2pdf</code>
to <code>xdag2pdf</code>.

   <p>Much improved type checking (and error output) for type annotations
and feature paths (esp. useful for principle type checking).

   <p>Version 0.9.6

   <p>Introduced the type 'type.any'. This can be used to bypass the type
checker, and is useful e.g. for the principles surrounding the notion
of agreement (<code>principle.agr</code>, <code>principle.agreement</code>,
<code>principle.government</code>). Here, 'type.any' is used for principle
arguments which are not known a priori. Notice that this type cannot
be used for values, only for feature paths (i.e. value descriptions).

   <p>Version 0.9.5

   <p>Due to popular request, type references (<code>ref</code>) and class
references (<code>useclass</code>) can now be invoked just by the
identifier, i.e. you can omit the respective keywords.

   <p>Examples: <code>ref("id.attrs")</code> can be written tersely as
<code>"id.attrs"</code>.  Similarly, <code>useclass "noncan" {Word:
"koennen"}</code> can be written tersely as <code>"noncan" {Word:
"koennen"}</code>.

   <p>You can use the shell script <code>ulterse</code> to convert an &ldquo;old
style&rdquo; UL grammar file into a &ldquo;new style&rdquo;, terser one, e.g. 
<code>./ulterse Acl01.ul</code> converts <code>Acl01.ul</code>.
