  abstract =     {Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) is a new
  lexicalized formalism where word order phenomena arise from the
  interaction of a non-ordered syntax tree with a projective
  topological tree, both related by an emancipation mechanism. TDG
  proved capable of an elegant account of German word-order
  phenomena. We apply it now to the modelization of word-order
  variation in the Dutch verb cluster and further extend it with an
  ordering principle that correctly accounts for the ordering of
  elements in the Mittelfeld.},
