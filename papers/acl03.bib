  abstract =     {We propose a meta-grammatical framework for dependency
  grammar, accommodating any number of dimensions and restricting
  their licensed models through the application of parametric
  principles. We first instantiate this framework to obtain the
  version of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) proposed by Duchier
  and Debusmann 2001. We then describe an extended instantiation which
  adds support for semantic dependencies (thus also providing an
  account of control and raising constructions) and meaning
  assembly.},
