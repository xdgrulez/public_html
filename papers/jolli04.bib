  abstract =     {We combine state-of-the-art techniques from
  computational linguistics and theorem proving to build an engine for
  playing text adventures, computer games with which the player
  interacts purely through natural language. The system employs a
  parser for dependency grammar and a generation system based on TAG,
  and has components for resolving and generating referring
  expressions. Most of these modules make heavy use of inferences
  offered by a modern theorem prover for description logic. Our game
  engine solves some problems inherent in classical text adventures,
  and is an interesting test case for the interaction between natural
  language processing and inference.},
