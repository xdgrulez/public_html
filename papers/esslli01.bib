  abstract =     {We introduce a new formulation of dependency grammar
  recently suggested in (Duchier/Debusmann 2001) (henceforth DD). DD
  shares with GB (Chomsky 1986) a notion of movement. In GB, movement
  is carried out by tree transformations. In DD, it is the effect of
  well-formedness conditions on dependency trees and does not involve
  transformations. We illustrate both kinds of movement by showing how
  both theories analyze German verb-second clauses. Then, we point out
  the similarities between GB and DD, and raise the question whether
  GB's transformational notion of movement could be replaced by DD's
  constraint-based account of movement.},
