  abstract =     {This essay advocates an EFL (English as a foreign
  language) dictionary for students visiting the English Language
  Teaching Centre (ELTC) at UMIST. It restricts itself to monolingual
  dictionaries for the advanced learner from the start, because this
  tends to serve most of the targeted students. It is divided into two
  parts, the first taking into consideration some of the most
  important general properties of adequate EFL dictionaries, whilst
  the second part fleshes out the genuine characteristics of the
  dictionary recommended, viz. the Oxford Advanced Learner's
  Dictionary (Hornby 1995).},
