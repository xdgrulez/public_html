  abstract =     {This paper describes `Fistame', a partial implementation
  of Kaplan/Kay 1994, written using the Prolog programming
  language. Fistame provides a framework for easy encoding of and
  working with finite-state automata.  The paper is divided into six
  sections (plus an appendix). Following this brief overview, Section
  2 is made up of an informal introduction to finite-state automata
  (henceforth `FSAs') in general, followed by a description of how to
  encode and operate upon them within Fistame in particular.  Section
  3 hereafter serves to expose the various operations Fistame
  provides, before Section 4 goes into more detail with revealing
  their concrete implementation. Section 5 is then solely dedicated to
  a rather advanced implemented algorithm (`minimize'). Section 6
  settles the paper with some concluding remarks.},
