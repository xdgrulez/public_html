  abstract =     {Recently, (Duchier 1999) presented a new,
  constraint-based axiomatization of dependency parsing. We propose to
  develop an abstract grammar formalism for Duchier's
  axiomatization. In addition, we propose to formulate on a high level
  of abstraction statements for expressing constraints on linear
  precedence. We believe that we can solve this part by adapting for
  dependency parsing Reape's 1994 notion of word order domains, which
  has already been thoroughly investigated in the context of HPSG for
  German.},
