  abstract = {This article encodes of Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG)
  (Joshi 1987) into a two-dimensional instance of Extensible
  Dependency Grammar (XDG).  We restrict our attention to TAG grammars
  where each elementary tree has precisely one anchor. By encoding TAG
  into XDG, we can make use of the constraint-based parsing techniques
  developed for XDG also for TAG (Duchier 1999, 2001). Among the
  highlights of XDG parsing is an efficient treatment of lexical
  ambiguity, and the possibility to postpone enumeration of
  analyses. XDG parsing also allows for the integration of
  preferences, which can be utilized to find the best solution without
  having to generate all solutions in advance.  This avenue of
  research has been started in (Dienes et al. 2003), and is in the
  focus of active research. The encoding also allows us to make use of
  large-scale TAG grammars for English (XTAG) and French (FTAG) in the
  context of XDG.  Another line of our research is the development of
  a syntax-semantics interface for XDG.  Because this syntax-semantics
  interface relies on dependency trees (ID trees) and is independent
  of word order, we could also use plug it in to obtain a
  syntax-semantics interface for these large TAG grammars.  Finally,
  the encoding can give us insights into the comparison of the grammar
  formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier/Debusmann
  2001), from which XDG originates, and TAG.},
