  abstract = {This paper introduces well-ordered derivation trees and
  makes use of this concept in a novel axiomatization of the TAG
  parsing problem as a constraint satisfaction problem.  Contrary to
  prior approaches, our axiomatization focuses on the derivation trees
  rather than the derived trees. Well-ordered derivation trees are our
  primary models, whereas the derived trees serve solely to determine
  word order.}
