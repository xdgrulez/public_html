  abstract =     {We introduce the new abstract notion of
  multi-dimensional lexicalized graph configuration problems,
  generalising over many important tasks in computational linguistics
  such as semantic assembly, surface realization and syntactic
  analysis, and integrating them. We present Extensible Dependency
  Grammar (XDG) as one instance of this notion.},
