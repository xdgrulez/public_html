  abstract =     {We propose a syntax-semantics interface that realises
  the mapping between syntax and semantics as a relation and does not
  make functionality assumptions in either direction.  This interface
  is stated in terms of Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), a
  grammar formalism we newly specify.  XDG's constraint-based parser
  supports the concurrent flow of information between any two levels
  of linguistic representation, even when only partial analyses are
  available.  This generalises the concept of underspecification.},
