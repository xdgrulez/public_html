  abstract =     {We present the first step towards a constraint-based
  syntax-semantics interface for Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG)
  (Duchier/Debusmann 2001). We extend TDG with a new level of
  representation called semantic dependency dag to capture the
  semantic dependencies and clearly separate this level from the
  syntactic dependency tree.  We stipulate an emancipation mechanism
  between these levels that relates semantic arguments to their
  syntactic realizations, and demonstrate its application with an
  elegant account of raising and control constructions.},
