  abstract =     {The imperfective paradox, a popular problem from
  temporal semantics, has motivated many researchers to invest a lot
  of work into looking for a solution for quite some time. The problem
  can be sketched as follows: The progressive form of some verbs
  logically entails its corresponding non-progressive form, whereas
  for other verbs, it does not. For example, one thinks of (1) as to
  logically entail (2), but not of (3) as to entail (4): (1) Max was
  running.  (2) Max ran.  (3) Max was building a house.  (4) Max built
  a house.  A solution to the imperfective paradox must correctly
  account for the different inferential behaviors of the above
  sentences by assigning to them logical forms that account for the
  entailment from (1) to (2), and block the entailment from (3) to
  (4).  Alex Lascarides has formulated such a solution in (Lascarides
  1988) and (Lascarides 1991). Her approach improves on previous
  accounts in that it is a principled solution: It also accounts for
  other aspectual phenomena such as the interaction of the progressive
  with universal quantification. We will however not dwell on her
  treatment of those other phenomena here.  This article is to be
  understood as a brief summary of Alex Lascarides' solution. We will
  begin with exhibiting Vendler's (1967) classification of aspect in
  section 2, which serves as the foundation for Lascarides'
  approach. Another building block for for Lascarides' solution is an
  extended version of the interval-based temporal logic IQ by Richards
  et al 1989, laid out in section 3. Thereafter, section 4 explicates
  Lascarides' formulation of a classification of aspect in IQ. Her
  solution to the imperfective paradox itself is the topic of section
  5, before section 6 concludes the article.},
