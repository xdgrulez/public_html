  abstract =     {We introduce the new grammar formalism of Extensible
  Dependency Grammar (XDG), enabling us to take the different
  dimensions of linguistic description more seriously than existing
  grammar formalisms. XDG treats the different linguistic dimensions
  as separate, autonomous dependency graphs.  We show how this allows
  us to naturally account for taxing phenomena such as free word
  order, control, and quantifier scope.},
