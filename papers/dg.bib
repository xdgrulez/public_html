  abstract =     {Many linguists consider Dependency Grammar (DG) to be
  inferior to established phrase structure based theories like GB
  (Chomsky 1986), LFG (Kaplan/Bresnan 1982) and HPSG (Pollard/Sag
  1994). The aim of this article is to remedy this state of affairs by
  seeking to make those unconvinced of DG perceive the benefits it
  offers. To this end, section 2 makes the reader acquainted with the
  basic concepts of DG, before section 3 sets the theory against
  phrase structure based theories, arguing that it has considerable
  advantages in the analysis of languages with relatively free word
  order (e.g. German, Finnish, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Russian
  ...). Section 4 describes Duchier's (1999) DG axiomatization as a
  prototypical example of a DG that separates dependencies and surface
  order. Thereafter, section 5 proceeds with an overview of current
  Dependency Grammar formalisms and section 6 rounds the paper up.},
