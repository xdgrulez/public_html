  abstract =     {Extensible dependency grammar (XDG) is a graph
  description language, whose formulas can be solved by constraint
  programming. XDG yields a declarative approach to natural language
  processing for parsing and generation. In this paper we present the
  XDG development kit, the first XDG-based grammar development system,
  which we implemented in Mozart/Oz. This includes an expressive
  lexicon specification language not published previously.},
