  abstract =     {We introduce a modular, dependency-based formalization
  of Information Structure (IS) based on Steedman's prosodic account
  (Steedman 2000, Steedman 2000a). We state it in terms of Extensible
  Dependency Grammar (XDG) (Debusmann et al. 2004), introducing two
  new dimensions modularly modeling 1) prosodic structure, and 2)
  theme/rheme and focus/background partitionings.  The approach goes
  without a non-standard syntactic notion of constituency, and can be
  straightforwardly extended to model interactions between IS and
  other dimensions such as word order},
