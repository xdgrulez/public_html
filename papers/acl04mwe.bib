  abstract =     {We propose to model multiword expressions as dependency
  subgraphs, and realize this idea in the grammar formalism of
  Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG). We extend XDG to lexicalize
  dependency subgraphs, and show how to compile them into simple
  lexical entries, amenable to parsing and generation with the
  existing XDG constraint solver.},
