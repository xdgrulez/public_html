  abstract =     {We propose a formal characterization of variation in the
  syntactic realization of semantic arguments, using hierarchies of
  syntactic relations and thematic roles, and a mechanism of lexical
  inheritance to obtain valency frames from individual linking
  types. We embed the formalization in the new lexicalized,
  dependency-based grammar formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar
  (TDG) (Duchier/Debusmann 2001).  We account for arguments that can
  be alternatively realized as a NP or a PP, and model thematic role
  alternations.  We also treat auxiliary constructions, where the
  correspondance between syntactic and semantic argumenthood is
  indirect.},
