  abstract =     {The paper introduces a generalisation of the grammar
  formalism of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and
  Debusmann 2001).  The result, eXtensible Dependency Grammar (XDG),
  is a description language for sets of labeled directed
  graphs. Lexicalisation turns XDG into a powerful dependency-based
  meta grammar formalism.  As an instance of XTDG, we present Semantic
  Topological Dependency Grammar (STDG), a new dependency-based
  grammar formalism with a syntax-semantics interface to
  underspecified semantics.},
