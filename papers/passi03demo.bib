  abstract =     {This paper introduces a parser system for the meta
  grammar formalism of eXtensible Dependency Grammar (XDG). XDG is a
  generalisation of Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and
  Debusmann 2001).  The XDG parser system comprises a constraint-based
  parser for all possible instances of XDG, a statically typed grammar
  input language, and a flexible backend for handling parser output. A
  powerful graphical user interface provides for easy accessibility of
  all the functionality of the system.},
