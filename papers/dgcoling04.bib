  abstract =     {This paper introduces the new grammar formalism of
  Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG), and emphasizes the benefits of
  its methodology of explaining complex phenomena by interaction of
  simple principles on multiple dimensions of linguistic description.
  This has the potential to increase modularity with respect to
  linguistic description and grammar engineering, and to facilitate
  concurrent processing and the treatment of ambiguity.},
